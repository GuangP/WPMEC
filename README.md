Deep Neural Network for Computation Rate Maximization in Wireless-powered Mobile Edge Computing

Python code to reproduce our works on Wireless-powered Mobile Edge Computing [1], which uses the wireless channel gains as the input and the binary computing mode selection results as the output of a deep neural network (DNN).
