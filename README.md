## WPMEC

Deep Neural Network for Computation Rate Maximization in Wireless-powered Mobile Edge Computing

Python code to reproduce our works on Wireless-powered Mobile Edge Computing [1], which uses the wireless channel gains as the input and the binary computing mode selection results as the output of a deep neural network (DNN). It includes:

- [dnn_wpmec.py](dnn_wpmec.py): the DNN structure for the WPMEC, inclduing training structure and test structure

- [data](./data): all data are stored in this subdirectory, includes:

  - **data_#.mat**: training and testing data sets, where # is the user number

  - **Prediction_#.mat**: the predicted mode selection generated by DNN_test

  - **weights_biases.mat**: parameters of the trained DNN, which are used to re-produce this trained DNN such as in MATLAB.

- [main.py](main.py): run this file, inclduing setting system parameters


## About our works

Please refer to our recent advantages in this topic as released at [DROO](https://github.com/revenol/DROO). Specifically, a Reinforcement learning-based online algorithm, [DROO](https://github.com/revenol/DROO), is proposed to maximize the weighted compuation rate in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Networks. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance while signiﬁcantly decreasing the computation time by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization methods. For example, the CPU execution latency of DROO is less than 0.1 second in a 30-user network, making real-time and optimal ofﬂoading truly viable even in a fast fading environment.
