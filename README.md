## WPMEC

Deep Neural Network for Computation Rate Maximization in Wireless-powered Mobile Edge Computing

Python code to reproduce our works on Wireless-powered Mobile Edge Computing [1], which uses the wireless channel gains as the input and the binary computing mode selection results as the output of a deep neural network (DNN). It includes:

- [dnn_wpmec.py](dnn_wpmec.py): the DNN structure for the WPMEC, inclduing training structure and test structure

- [data](./data): all data are stored in this subdirectory, includes:

  - **data_#.mat**: training and testing data sets, where # is the user number

  - **Prediction_#.mat**: the predicted mode selection generated by DNN_test

  - **weights_biases.mat**: parameters of the trained DNN, which are used to re-produce this trained DNN such as in MATLAB.

- [main.py](main.py): run this file, inclduing setting system parameters
